ChatCompletionMessage(content="In the land of code where logic reigns,\nThere dwells a concept that knows no chains.\nRecursion, a majestic art,\nUnraveling loops within the heart.\n\nLike a mirror reflecting a reflection,\nIt calls upon itself without defection.\nA function that calls its own name,\nRepeating steps in a recursive flame.\n\nAs the branches of a tree reach high,\nRecursion ascends to touch the sky.\nEach iteration peels a layer,\nUnraveling tasks with coding flair.\n\nIt dances gracefully in loops untold,\nA magical spell of patterns bold.\nA journey deeper with each call,\nA recursive dream, standing tall.\n\nSo heed the call of recursion's voice,\nIn programming realms, it is a choice.\nAn elegant design, complex and rare,\nIn the realm of code, it's beyond compare.", role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None)
