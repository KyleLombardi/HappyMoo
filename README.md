# About MooDy

MooDy is your personal health and wellness assistant! MooDy intelligently and adaptively summarizes different aspects of your life like sleep habits, physical activity, and wellness by using data from your health app. Over time, MooDy learns more about your unique health profile, and points you to useful resources like blog posts and YouTube videos for your areas of focus. 

MooDy uses the ReactNative API to interface with users and collect data from Apple Health's API, AppleHealthKit. It synchronizes data between the two apps. MooDy itself lives in the backend as a unique Assistant who makes calls to the OpenAI API. MooDy has the power to scour files for relevant health information and provide health insights.
