# About MooDy

MooDy is your personal health and wellness assistant! MooDy intelligently and adaptively summarizes different aspects of your life like sleep habits, physical activity, and wellness by using data from your health app. 

MooDy uses the ReactNative API to interface with users and collect data from Apple Health's API, AppleHealthKit. MooDy itself lives in the backend as a user-unique Assistant who makes calls to the OpenAI API. MooDy has the power to scour files for relevant health information and provide health insights.

We have many updates in the works! For example, we're working to implement intelligent sampling, placing greater value on more recent health information and taking fewer samples from old datasets. Soon, MooDy will also be able to point you to useful resources like blog posts and YouTube videos for your areas of focus.
